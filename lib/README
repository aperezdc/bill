This is the top-level directory of the Bill module repository. Modules will
be automatically searched here when use-ing them.

Documentation for modules can be autogenerated by typing "make doc" at the
top level source directory (if you have the full sources, of course.)

If a new category is added, please add a small snippet of text inside
a "README" file. Those will be assembled by the "gen-module-index" script in
the module index page.
