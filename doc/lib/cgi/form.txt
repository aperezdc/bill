:Abstract: Handles input in the formats provided by HTML forms.
    This includes submissions in the ``multipart/form-data`` and
    ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` encodings. This functionality
    is typically needed in CGI scripts.

  form_multipart_handle directory


Decodes standard input in ``multipart/form-data`` encoding to multiple
files in a directory. The directory will be laid out as follows, for
a directory named ``output``:

``output/pack``
    File containing the  unprocessed input, minus the marker present
    at the last line.
``output/raw/*``
    Each file inside this directory is an unprocessed part of the input.
``output/body/*``
    Each file inside this directory contains the bodies of the parts.
``output/headers/*``
    Each file inside this directory contains the MIME headers of each
    part.

For example, the first part will be named ``00`` (double-zero),
``output/raw/00`` would be the unprocessed part, ``output/body/00``
its content body and ``output/headers/00`` the corresponding MIME
headers. Each part is decoded using the mime_decode_ function.
