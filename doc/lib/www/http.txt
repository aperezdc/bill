.. contents::




http_mimetype_guess
-------------------

::

  http_mimetype_guess path





http_error_document
-------------------

::

  http_error_document [ code [ description ... ] ]


Generates an error document in standard output:

* ``code`` is the HTTP error code (default is ``500``)
* ``description`` is an arbitrary piece of text which will be inserted
  pre-formatted in the output.





http_error
----------

::

  http_error [ code [ description ... ] ]


Sends an HTTP error status code and an accompanying HTML document
explaining the error.




http_log_stderr
---------------

::

  http_log_stderr [ arg1 [ arg2 ... [ argN ] ] ]


Logs a line of output to standard error.




http_handle_GET
---------------

::

  http_handle_GET


Default handler for the HTTP ``GET`` method. This does nothing more than
serving static files and producing directory listings. Also, if path
resolves to a directory which contains a file named ``index.html`` it
will be served instead.




http_handle_request
-------------------

::

  http_handle_request [ handler_prefix ]


Serves a single HTTP request. The following variables are set by the
function and their values **will be clamped** if already defined. Note
that most of them start with the ``HTTP_`` prefix or have names of the
variables used by the `CGI interface`_:

* REQUEST_METHOD
* PATH_INFO
* QUERY_STRING
* ...and so on.
