    Provides support for nicer handling of features like ECMA-48 (ANSI)
    color codes.

ECMA-48 graphics rendition
==========================
Support for using ECMA-48 escape sequences (also known as ANSI color
escapes) is provided by using tty_color_fg_, tty_color_bg_ and other
related functions.

Typical usage
-------------
There are some usage patterns which you may want to know prior to start
using the module. The most important one follows the *avoid doing the
same operation twice* motto: calling tty_color_fg_ and tty_color_bg_ is
not cheap in terms of efficiency, but their result can be saved for
later use. So instead of:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    echo "$(tty_color_fg red) This is RED $(tty_color_fg reset)"
    echo "$(tty_color_fg red) This one too... $(tty_color_fg reset)"

it is better to save results in variables and reuse the values:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    red=$(tty_color_fg red)
    reset=$(tty_color_fg reset)
    echo "$red This is RED $reset"
    echo "$red This one too... $reset"

This way your scripts will run faster and your code will be cleaner.


Functions
=========




tty_color_alias
---------------

::

  tty_color_alias colorname


Obtains the real color for a given color name, resolving aliases as
needed.

.. note:: In the current implementation only **one** level of
   indirection is resolved. That should be enough for all cases.




tty_color_fg
------------

::

  tty_color_fg attribute1 [ attribute2 [ ... attributeN ] ]


Obtains the ECMA-48 escape sequence needed to apply a determinate
graphics rendition in the foreground. The escape sequence will apply
*all* the given attributes. See `typical usage`_ above for tips on
how to use this function.




tty_color_bg
------------

::

  tty_color_bg attribute1 [ attribute2 [ ... attributeN ] ]


Obtains the ECMA-48 escape sequence needed to apply a determinate
graphics rendition in the background. The escape sequence will apply
*all* the given attributes. See `typical usage`_ above for tips on
how to use this function.
