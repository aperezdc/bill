:Abstract: Provides functions of common usage in shell code.
    This module is always imported by the Bill interpreter at startup.

.. contents::




warn
----

::

  warn message


Prints a message to the standard error stream.




die
---

::

  die [ message ]


Exits running process with a non-zero status, optionally printing an
error message before exiting.




need
----

::

  need tool1 [ tool2 [ ... [ toolN ] ] ]


Checks whether a list of commands are available on the system and can be
accessed by means of the current ``$PATH`` setting. If one of the
dependencies is not met, return status will be non-zero. If you want to
know exactly which tool was not found then check the tools one at
a time:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    need openssl || die "openssl not found"
    need convert || die "ImageMagick is not installed"




use
---

::

  use module


Loads one module from the library search path, which is itself
taken from the ``$BILLPATH`` environment variable. If a module is not
found, execution will be aborted and an informative message will be
printed to standard error.

The function will search for a function named the same as the module
name with slashes changed to underscores, prefixed with
``__bill_module__``. If the function is found, it will be executed
instead of sourcing the module from disk.

On successful module load the module name will be appended to the
``bill_loaded_modules`` array, and when trying to load the module
afterwards will do nothing.




main
----

::

  main


Checks whether a module is running as a standalone script and runs the
supplied function with a set of arguments. This allows modules both being
imported and for acting as a script. For example.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    foo () {
        echo "I am foo"
    }

    main foo
