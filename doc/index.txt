:Abstract: Bill strives to be a solution for developing applications which
    can be run on platforms with limited resources (e.g. embedded systems)
    on top of the GNU Bash_ shell, with a focus on quality and reusability
    of shell code.

    It does so by providing module system with its standard library, which
    you can leverage in your own scripts, both by using existing modules
    and splitting your program in reusable components.

    Additionally, tools for documenting and testing modules, and serving web
    applications are provided as part of the package.

   Bill architecture

As a quick summary, Bill brings to you:

* Ability of running on small, embedded systems with scarce resources.
* Bash_ as the only dependency. Choose one of netpipes_, ipsvd_ or
  ucspi-tcp_ for TCP sockets support.
* Module system for shell code.
* Standard `library <module-index.html>`__ (batteries included!)
* `Billets <billets.html>`_ container.
* Creation of `standalone <deploy.html>`__ scripts.
* Tools for documentation_ generation.
* Tools for writing unit tests.

Last, but not least Bill also has the following:

* Catchy name.
* “Stolen” `logo <http://xbill.org>`__.
