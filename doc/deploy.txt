 Deploying Bill scripts
========================

:Author: Adrián Pérez <aperez@igalia.com>
:Abstract: Explains how to produce standalone shell scripts which do not
    need the Bill runtime to be installed in order to work. The only
    requirement will be a recent enough installation of Bash.


Use the ``unbill`` script to produce a standalone version of a script::

    $ ./scripts/bill/bill scripts/unbill myscript > myscript-standalone


.. vim: expandtab filetype=rst shiftwidth=4 tabstop=4
